### Objective
This PostgreSQL database is designed to efficiently manage and organize the operations of a network of ice cream shops. It includes information about employees, the shops themselves, their locations, and suppliers. Below is a brief description of each table within the database:

### Employees: 
This table stores information about the employees working at the ice cream shops. It includes details such as employee IDs, names, contact information, job titles, and the shops they are assigned to.

### Ice_Cream_Shops: 
This table contains data about the individual ice cream shops within the network. It includes shop IDs, names, descriptions, and other relevant details about each shop.

### Locations: 
This table keeps track of the geographical locations of the ice cream shops. It includes location IDs, addresses, city, state, postal codes, and possibly geographic coordinates for mapping and analysis purposes.

### Suppliers: 
This table holds information about the suppliers that provide ingredients and other goods to the ice cream shops. It includes supplier IDs, names, contact details, and the types of products they supply.

The database is structured to facilitate the management of the ice cream shop network, enabling efficient coordination between employees, accurate tracking of shop locations, and effective supplier management. This setup ensures streamlined operations, better inventory control, and improved overall business performance.
